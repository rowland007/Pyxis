This page is incomplete but will be updated as the application progresses. Currently, you can clone the repo and then open it in Android Project. It will create a Gradle project for you, and you're ready to compile.  

The Master branch will always be stable and the development branch will not be pushed to Master until stable. Documentation changes may be pushed to Master.
