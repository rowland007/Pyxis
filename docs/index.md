The idea is to closely mirror that of the actual application to make the transition easier for end users.

## Documentation

Pyxis uses the [unofficial Pandora API documentation](https://6xq.net/pandora-apidoc/).

## Install Pyxis

Pyxis will only be available through F-Droid. However, it is currently **NOT** available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) yet.

## Why the name "Pyxis"?

The original Pandora myth used the word [pithos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora#Pithos_into_%22box%22), a large storage jar but during a mistranslation, [pyxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyxis_(vessel)) was used meaning a box.
