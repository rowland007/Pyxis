Pyxis is a native Pandora Radio client for Android ROMs that do not have Google Play Services.
## Documentation

## Install Pyxis
Pyxis will only be available through F-Droid. However, it is currently **NOT** available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) yet.
## Why the name "Pyxis"?
The original Pandora myth used the word [pithos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora#Pithos_into_%22box%22), a large storage jar but during a mistranslation, [pyxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyxis_(vessel)) was used meaning a box.
