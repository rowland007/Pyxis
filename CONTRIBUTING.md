# Pull Request Process
## Making your changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Create a new branch for your changes.
* Make your changes.
* Make sure you include tests (if applicable).
* Make sure the test suite passes after your changes.
* Commit your changes into that branch.
* Use descriptive and meaningful commit messages.
    -   See [commit template] or [How to Write a Git Commit Message]
* If you have a lot of commits, squash them into a single commit.
* Make sure you use the `-S` flag when committing as explained above.
* Push your changes to your branch in your forked repository.

## Submitting the changes

Submit a pull request via the normal GitHub UI.
- Describe the pull request's impact on the project in the title, as follows:      
    - `Added` - for new features.
    - `Changed` - for changes in existing functionality.
    - `Deprecated` - for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.
    - `Removed` - for deprecated features removed in this release.
    - `Fixed` - for any bug fixes.
    - `Security` - to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.
    - `[WIP]` - **DO NOT USE** in `master` branch
- Include the purpose of this Pull Request in the description. For example: `This is a spike to explore…`, `This simplifies the display of…`, `This fixes handling of…`
- Consider providing an overview of why the work is taking place (with any relevant links); don’t assume familiarity with the history.
- Remember that anyone could be reading this Pull Request, so the content and tone may inform people other than those taking part, now or later.
- Be explicit about what feedback you want, if any: a quick pair of :eyes: on the code, discussion on the technical approach, critique on design, a review of copy.
- Be explicit about when you want feedback, if the Pull Request is work in progress, say so. A prefix of “`[WIP]`” in the title is a simple, common pattern to indicate that state.
- @mention individuals that you specifically want to involve in the discussion, and mention why. (“/cc @rowland007 for clarification on this logic”)
- @mention teams that you want to involve in the discussion, and mention why. (“/cc @github/security, any concerns with this approach?”)
 
## After submitting

* Do not use your branch for any other development, otherwise further changes that you make will be visible in the PR.

### Offering feedback
- Familiarize yourself with the context of the issue, and reasons why this Pull Request exists.
- If you disagree strongly, consider giving it a few minutes before responding; think before you react.
- Ask, don’t tell. (“What do you think about trying…?” rather than “Don’t do…”)
- Explain your reasons why code should be changed. (Not in line with the style guide? A personal preference?)
- Offer ways to simplify or improve code.
- Avoid using derogatory terms, like “stupid”, when referring to the work someone has produced.
- Be humble. (“I’m not sure, let’s try…”)
- Avoid hyperbole. (“NEVER do…”)
- Aim to develop professional skills, group knowledge and product quality, through group critique.
- Be aware of negative bias with online communication. (If content is neutral, we assume the tone is negative.) Can you use positive language as opposed to neutral?
- You may use emoji to clarify tone. Compare “:sparkles: :sparkles: Looks good :+1: :sparkles: :sparkles:” to “Looks good.”
### Responding to feedback
- Consider leading with an expression of appreciation, especially when feedback has been mixed.
- Ask for clarification. (“I don’t understand, can you clarify?”)
- Offer clarification, explain the decisions you made to reach a solution in question.
- Try to respond to every comment.
- Link to any follow up commits or Pull Requests. (“Good call! Done in 1682851”)
- As a last resort, if there is growing confusion or debate, ask yourself if the written word is still the best form of communication. Talk (virtually) face-to-face, then mutually consider posting a follow-up to summarize any offline discussion (useful for others who be following along, now or later).
